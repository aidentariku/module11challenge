This project encompasses scraping and analyzing data related to Mars, focusing on news articles and weather data. Utilizing Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Pandas, we extract valuable insights from various online sources. The project consists of two Jupyter Notebooks: part_1_mars_news.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb, which detail the step-by-step process of scraping and analyzing Mars news and weather data, respectively. Additionally, the extracted data is stored in the mars_data.csv file for further examination or sharing. Through this project, we aim to gain deeper insights into Mars-related information and enhance our understanding of the red planet's dynamics.
